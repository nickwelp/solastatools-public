  ED🐴 is an improved, more accurate CR (Challenge Rating) for D&D 5e combat in Solasta.
</div>
<div class="block">
  <b>Estimated Difficulty (ED🐴)</b> indicates the level of the player party to achieve victory in combat 
  against the given monster(s) with minimal depletion. 
  The ED🐴 can represent an entire combat encounter with many monsters or a single monster.
</div>
<div class="block">
  <b>Party Depletion</b> is how much of the party resources have been used and signals how soon the party will need a short or long rest. 
  Player character (PC) HP, deaths, and other factors influence depletion and ED🐴.
</div>
<div class="block">
  <b>XP Adjustment</b> is the delta of ED🐴 XP vs Solasta monster CR. When XP Adjustment is positive, 
  you should grant additional XP to match the difficulty of the encounter. 
  For example, if you enhance a CR 0.5 Goblin to be a Super Goblin ED🐴 5, the XP Adjustment calculation is (1800/4 - 100/4) = +425 XP. 
  Note that the XP indicates individual PC (player character) XP, not party XP. XP Adjustments are already divided by 4. 
  Solasta's Grant XP Gadget awards the individual XP amount per party member.

  The Solasta combat simulation's party composition is the canonical fighter, cleric, rogue, wizard.
  The linear regression model calculates statistics from
  hundreds or thousands of combat encounter simulations before recommending an ED🐴.

  Examples:
  <ul>
    <li>party level 1 vs 2x Ghouls ED🐴1 -> 10% depleted, can win many of these before resting</li>
    <li>party level 1 vs 5x Goblin ED🐴1 -> 20% depleted, can win multiple of these before resting</li>
    <li>party level 2 vs 1x Darkweaver ED🐴4 -> 50% depleted, may TPK (total party kill), will need to revive downed party members, long rest</li>
    <li>party level 5 vs 1x Green Dragon ED🐴12 -> 100% depleted, will TPK, Game Over, zero chance of winning</li>
    <li>party level 12 vs 1x Green Dragon ED🐴12 -> 15% depleted, easily winnable (even if it shouldn't be)</li>
    <li>party level 12 vs 2x Green Dragon ED🐴12 -> 55% depleted, may TPK, will need to revive downed, long rest</li>
  </ul>
